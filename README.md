Detection of Covert attacks on cyber-physical systems using Markovian jump linear systems

This repository contains all Matlab algorithms I used during the development of my Master's thesis "Detection of Covert attacks on cyber-physical systems using Markovian jump linear systems". 

Here goes a list with their names and a short description of what each of them does:

1) Discretization: creates a discrete-time system from matrices of a continuous-time dynamic system model
2)
