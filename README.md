Detection of Covert attacks on cyber-physical systems using Markovian jump linear systems

This repository contains all Matlab algorithms I used during the development of my Master's thesis "Detection of Covert attacks on cyber-physical systems using Markovian jump linear systems". 

Here goes a list with their names and a short description of what each of them does:

1) Discretization: creates a discrete-time system from matrices of a continuous-time dynamic system model. I used it to discretize the quadruple tank model.
2) 
3)Eigenvalues: calculates the eigenvalues of a system. I used it to evaluate the stability of the obtained auxiliary system. The closer the eigenvalues are from 1, the less stable is the system.
